            <p>I grew up in Victor, New York which is very close to the University of Rochester. Growing up, I really enjoyed soccer and playing sports. I was on the soccer and track teams all the way up until the ninth grade. My mindset changed when I performed in my first musical.</p>
            <p>It was a very unknown, older show called “Man of La Mancha,” and I had a very small part. It was then that I noticed that I was worlds happier performing than playing in sports. I was always in the middle of the pack in sports, not the worst kid but also very far from the best. If I could have a very small part in the show and be more excited about it, I knew I had to make a change.</p>
         </div>
         <div id="section2" class = "sections">
            <h1>High School Theatre</h1>
            <p>I then went full speed ahead and pursued theatre. I did not concern myself with going to stressful tryouts or the grueling conditioning practices. The way I played sports, there was always a ranking and everyone was always fighting to get to the top. It was exhausting. With theatre, I did not feel this pressure and felt more joy regardless of the size of the role I got. With my new found passion, I started doing more plays and musicals. I met some amazing people, and the course of my life changed. It all came full circle my senior year when I got the role of Ariel in our production of “The Little Mermaid.” It was an extremely rewarding process, and I would go back to that moment in a heartbeat.</p>

         <div id="section3" class = "sections">
            <h1>Early College</h1>
            <p>When I started at the University of Rochester, I knew I wanted to do theatre here as well. It was such an important role for me back in high school, so it was imperative that I found it again. At the Fall Activities Fair, I found a group called ROC Players. They did full-length musical theatre, and it was super interesting because it was completely student-run. I had never done student-run theatre before, so I was excited for the challenge. I signed up to audition, and I was cast in their fall show of “Into the Woods.” It was a very happy moment for me. </p>
         </div>
         <div id="section4" class = "sections">
            <h1>Now</h1>
            <p>As a junior in college, I have been a part of each show ROC Players has done in the past two years. I was an angry stepsister in “Into the Woods,” a tyrannical parent in “Spring Awakening,” and a comedic dancer during the Nazi era in “Cabaret.” I became a Stage Manager, something I never thought I would be able to do in theatre. I always saw myself on the stage, so it was incredible to finally go behind the scenes to see how the magic happens. In addition, I was elected to be the Artistic Director of the group in the most recent elections. This group has given me so much, and I can’t wait to return the favor and give it back to them in my junior year. Trying something new and unexpected can be scary, but it has completely given me a new perspective on my life and goals. </p>
